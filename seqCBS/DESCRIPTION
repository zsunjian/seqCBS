Description: This is a method for DNA Copy Number Profiling using
        Next-Generation Sequencing. It has new model and test
        statistics based on non-homogeneous Poisson Processes with
        change point models. It uses an adaptation of Circular Binary
        Segmentation. Also included are methods for point-wise Bayesian
        Confidence Interval and model selection method for the
        change-point model. A case and a control sample reads (normal
        and tumor) are required.
